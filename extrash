## Research Projects Submissions

**SMILP: Structuring the Mixed Integer Linear Programming Space** (Under review)  
*Lead author, University of Luxembourg. PI: Dr. Danoy.*  
Submitted to the [FNR CORE](https://www.fnr.lu/funding-instruments/core/) research program call, to fund a 2-year postdoc and a 4-year PhD student.

SMILP aims to improve ML-based MILP solvers by introducing structural similarity metrics and clustering, enabling portfolio-based solving strategies with specialized ML models for instance groups. The project will develop hybrid learning methods and integrate with open-source tools ([SCIP solver](https://www.scipopt.org/), [MIPLIB instance library](https://miplib.zib.de/)).
