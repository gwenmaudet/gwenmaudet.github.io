## Introduction

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Luxembourg, working on the integration of machine learning techniques to enhance the performance of solvers for Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems. My research focuses on developing methods based on genetic programming to produce human-readable algorithms, as well as on defining structural representations (such as distance measures and clustering) within the space of MILP instances.

Previously, I completed my PhD at IMT Atlantique in Rennes, working on data transmission strategies for highly constrained sensor networks with large numbers of nodes. This involved designing sensor similarity measures using sparse and noisy data, dynamic clustering, and proposing adaptive fleet management strategies.
