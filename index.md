# Gwen Maudet

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Luxembourg, specializing in the integration of machine learning techniques with combinatorial optimization and large-scale sensor networks. My work focuses on developing interpretable machine learning models for MILP solvers and on energy-efficient strategies for IoT systems.
