## About Me

Currently a **postdoctoral researcher** in the PCOG team at **SnT, University of Luxembourg**, I work on integrating Machine Learning methods into Mixed Integer Programming solvers.

In December 2023, I completed my PhD in computer science at IMT Atlantique in Rennes, researching energy efficiency strategies for large-scale IoT networks, focusing on the concept of similarity: how to evaluate and exploit it.

I also hold a general engineering degree from IMT Atlantique, with a specialization in decision support tools.
